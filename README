Shows how to use the UTI document declarations:

(http://developer.apple.com/library/IOs/#documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/DocumentBasedAppPGiOS/DocumentImplPreflight/DocumentImplPreflight.html)


Document declaration in the app DocTypes-Info.plist file.

2 properties you should look at that were added to this plist:
•Document Types Array and an example
•ExportedTypeUTIs


You can now open pdb files that you get in mail from your iOS device with your app…

app delegate needs the following override to receive the file (notice the 2 options, if the app is already launched, and if the app is cold when signaled to launch with the file) :

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    self.window = [[[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]] autorelease];
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    self.window.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
    
    
    NSURL *url = (NSURL *)[launchOptions valueForKey:UIApplicationLaunchOptionsURLKey];
    NSLog(@"URL = %@", [url description]);
    if ([url isFileURL]) 
    {
        //Do something with the file URL!
    }

    
    
    return YES;
}


- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation
{
    NSLog(@"URL = %@", [url description]);
    if ([url isFileURL]) 
    {
        //Do something with the file URL!
    }

    return YES;
}
